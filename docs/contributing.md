# Contributing

We welcome contributions to the Agentic Graph RAG project!

## Code Style

*   **Python:** We follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide. We use `black` for code formatting and `ruff` for linting.
*   **Docstrings:** We use Google-style docstrings. All public modules, classes, and functions should have a docstring.
*   **Type Hinting:** All function signatures should include type hints.

## Testing

The project uses `pytest` for testing. To run the tests, execute the following command from the root directory:

```bash
pytest
```
