## The SuperSuite Workflow

SuperSuite transforms your documents into queryable knowledge through a simple 6-step process:

```
üìÅ Create Project ‚Üí üìÑ Upload Document ‚Üí ‚öôÔ∏è Process ‚Üí üé® View Ontology ‚Üí üìä Explore Knowledge ‚Üí üí¨ Query Chat
```

### Step 1: Create Project
Organize your documents by creating projects. Each project can contain multiple documents and maintains its own knowledge graph.

**Use Cases:**
- Research paper collection
- Company policy documents
- Customer support tickets
- Legal contracts
- Technical documentation

### Step 2: Upload Document
Add PDF documents to your project. SuperSuite supports:
- Text-based PDFs
- Multi-page documents
- Documents with tables and lists
- Technical and academic papers

### Step 3: Process Document
SuperSuite's AI engine:
- Extracts text from PDF
- Analyzes content structure
- Proposes optimal entity schema
- Extracts entities and relationships
- Stores data in Snowflake and Neo4j

### Step 4: View Ontology
Explore the automatically generated knowledge schema:
- Entity types (Person, Organization, Skill, etc.)
- Relationship types (WORKS_FOR, HAS_SKILL, etc.)
- Schema properties and constraints

### Step 5: Explore Knowledge
Browse the extracted knowledge:
- View all entities by type
- See entity properties
- Explore relationships
- Filter and search

### Step 6: Query with Chat
Ask questions in natural language:
- "Who are the key people mentioned?"
- "What organizations are involved?"
- "Summarize the main topics"
- "Find all skills related to data science"
