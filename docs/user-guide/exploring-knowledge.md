# Exploring Knowledge

Learn how to extract and explore the knowledge base created from your documents.

---

## Overview

The Knowledge Base tab allows you to:
- Extract structured entities from documents
- Browse entities by type (Persons, Organizations, Concepts)
- View entity details and properties
- Explore relationships between entities
- Analyze knowledge base statistics

This is where you see the actual data extracted from your documents.

---

## Prerequisites

## Understanding the Knowledge Base

### Entity Tables

Each entity type gets its own table:
- **Person** - Individuals mentioned in documents
- **Organization** - Companies and institutions
- **Concept** - Ideas and topics
- **Skill** - Abilities and competencies
- **Education** - Academic qualifications
- **Location** - Geographic places
- **Event** - Occurrences and happenings
- **Product** - Items and services

**Table Structure:**
- **ID** - Unique identifier
- **Attributes** - Properties defined in ontology
- **Dynamic Columns** - Based on ontology schema

---

### Relationships

Relationships connect entities:
- **From Node** - Source entity ID
- **To Node** - Target entity ID
- **Relationship** - Type of connection
- **Properties** - Additional metadata

**Example Relationships:**
```
Harshit ‚Üí works_for ‚Üí TechCorp
Harshit ‚Üí has_skill ‚Üí Python
Harshit ‚Üí studied_at ‚Üí MIT
TechCorp ‚Üí located_in ‚Üí San Francisco
```

---

## Working with Entity Data

### Searching Entities

Use the search box above each table:
1. Type search term
2. Table filters automatically
3. Shows matching rows only
4. Clear search to see all

**Search Tips:**
- Search any column
- Case-insensitive
- Partial matches work
- Use quotes for exact match

---

### Sorting Entities

Click column headers to sort:
- **First Click** - Sort ascending (A‚ÜíZ, 0‚Üí9)
- **Second Click** - Sort descending (Z‚ÜíA, 9‚Üí0)
- **Third Click** - Remove sort

**Sort Indicators:**
- ‚ñ≤ - Ascending
- ‚ñº - Descending
- No arrow - Not sorted

---

### Exporting Data

To export entity data:
1. Right-click on table
2. Select "Download as CSV"
3. Save file to your computer
4. Open in Excel or other tools

**Export Uses:**
- Data analysis
- Reporting
- Integration with other systems
- Backup

---

## Best Practices

### Knowledge Extraction
1. **Extract After Ontology** - Ensure ontology is generated first
2. **Review Results** - Check extracted entities make sense
3. **Validate Data** - Verify accuracy of extracted information
4. **Re-extract if Needed** - If results are poor, regenerate ontology

### Data Exploration
1. **Start with Overview** - Get big picture first
2. **Browse Each Type** - Check all entity tables
3. **Examine Relationships** - Understand connections
4. **Search Specific Entities** - Find particular items

### Quality Checks
1. **Entity Count** - Should match document content
2. **Attribute Completeness** - Most fields should be populated
3. **Relationship Accuracy** - Connections should be logical
4. **No Duplicates** - Same entity shouldn't appear multiple times

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Entities Extracted
**Problem:** Knowledge base is empty after extraction

**Solutions:**
1. Verify ontology was generated
2. Check documents were processed
3. Ensure PDFs contain structured content
4. Try regenerating ontology
5. Check Snowflake for data

---

### Missing Attributes
**Problem:** Entity tables have empty columns

**Solutions:**
1. Check if attributes exist in documents
2. Review ontology attribute definitions
3. Verify document content quality
4. Try re-processing documents
5. Check AI extraction logs

---

### Incorrect Relationships
**Problem:** Relationships don't make sense

**Solutions:**
1. Review document content
2. Check ontology relationship definitions
3. Verify entity extraction accuracy
4. Try regenerating ontology
5. Report issue for investigation

---

### Extraction Fails
**Problem:** Error during knowledge extraction

**Solutions:**
1. Check API credentials (DeepSeek)
2. Verify Snowflake connection
3. Ensure Neo4j is accessible
4. Try again after a few minutes
5. Check error message for details
