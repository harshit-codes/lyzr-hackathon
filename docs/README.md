## 🎯 What is SuperSuite?

SuperSuite is a comprehensive document intelligence platform consisting of three integrated components:

### 🔍 SuperScan
Analyzes documents and proposes optimal knowledge schemas using advanced AI. SuperScan understands your document content and automatically suggests entity types and relationships.

### 📚 SuperKB (Knowledge Base)
Extracts structured knowledge from documents and stores it in both Snowflake (for analytics) and Neo4j (for graph queries). SuperKB transforms unstructured text into queryable knowledge graphs.

### 💬 SuperChat
Provides an intelligent conversational interface to query your knowledge base. Ask questions in natural language and get accurate answers based on your documents.
