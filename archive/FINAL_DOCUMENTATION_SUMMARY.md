## ⚠️ What Needs Attention

### Automation Challenges

**Issue:** Streamlit's dynamic UI uses different selectors than expected

**Affected Steps:**
- Step 2: Project Creation - Can't find input fields
- Step 3: Document Upload - Can't find file uploader
- Step 4: Document Processing - Can't find process button
- Step 7: Chat Interface - Can't find chat input

**Impact:** Partial automation only (3/7 steps fully automated)

**Solution Options:**
1. **Manual Testing** (Recommended for now) - Complete workflow manually
2. **Script Enhancement** (For future) - Update selectors after DOM inspection

### Documentation Gaps

**Missing Files:**
- 5 user guide files (uploading, processing, ontology, knowledge, chat)
- 4 technical documentation files
- 3 reference files
- 7 additional screenshots (from manual testing)

**Impact:** Documentation is 60% complete

**Solution:** Complete after manual testing provides remaining screenshots

## 💡 Key Insights

### What We Learned

1. **Streamlit Testing Challenges:**
   - Dynamic UI rendering makes automation challenging
   - Element selectors change between versions
   - Manual testing may be more reliable for documentation

2. **Documentation Approach:**
   - GitBook structure works well for organization
   - Screenshot placeholders help plan content
   - Incremental approach is effective

3. **Automation Value:**
   - Even partial automation provides value
   - Screenshots captured are usable
   - Error states help identify issues

### Recommendations for Future

1. **For Documentation:**
   - Complete manual testing first
   - Use automation for regression testing
   - Keep screenshots updated with each release

2. **For Automation:**
   - Invest time in DOM inspection
   - Use more robust selectors (data-testid)
   - Add Streamlit-specific test attributes to code

3. **For Workflow:**
   - Manual testing for initial documentation
   - Automation for ongoing validation
   - Hybrid approach is most effective
