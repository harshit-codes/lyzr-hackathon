## Issues to Watch For

### Potential Issues
1. **Service Initialization Errors**
   - If you see "Failed to initialize services", check .env file
   - Ensure Snowflake, Neo4j, DeepSeek credentials are correct

2. **Processing Timeouts**
   - Document processing may take 30-60 seconds
   - Don't refresh the page during processing

3. **Empty Results**
   - If ontology or knowledge base is empty, check Snowflake data
   - Verify document was actually processed (status = "Processed")

4. **Chat Not Working**
   - Ensure knowledge base was extracted first
   - Check DeepSeek API key is valid

### How to Report Issues
If you encounter any errors:
1. Take screenshot of the error
2. Note the step where it occurred
3. Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
4. Report back with details
