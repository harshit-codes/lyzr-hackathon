## Engineering Principles (Lyzr Engineer Traits)

Build like a Lyzr engineer:
- **Think deeply** - Understand the problem at its core
- **Reason clearly** - Document your thought process and decisions
- **Build intelligently** - Create production-quality solutions
- **Production-quality thinking** - Clean architecture, modular design, clarity of thought
- **Build like a researcher, think like a founder**

---

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Document-to-Graph Pipeline
- LLM-powered automatic ontology generation
  - Entities (people, places, concepts, objects)
  - Relationships (typed connections between entities)
  - Hierarchies (taxonomies and class structures)
- OpenAI embedding integration for all graph elements
- Automated knowledge graph construction with entity resolution and deduplication

### 2. Visual Ontology Editor
- Interactive UI for ontology refinement
- LLM-assisted modifications and suggestions
- Retrieval testing interface
- Real-time graph visualization

### 3. Agentic Retrieval System
- **Dynamic tool selection** - Agent determines optimal strategy
  - Vector search (semantic similarity via OpenAI embeddings)
  - Graph traversal (relationship-based queries via Cypher/Gremlin)
  - Logical filtering (metadata/attribute constraints)
- Multi-step reasoning with iterative refinement
- Streaming responses with reasoning chains
- Hybrid relevance scoring across retrieval methods

### 4. Unified Retrieval Server
- Common extensible interface supporting:
  - Neo4j
  - AWS Neptune
- Clean APIs/SDKs for integration
- Versioned ontology support

### 5. Entity Resolution & Deduplication
- Intelligent entity matching across documents
- Fuzzy matching with configurable thresholds
- Merge strategies for conflicting information

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Guidelines**:
- **Focus on reasoning, structure, and clarity** - Care about 'how', not just 'what'
- **Demonstrate depth** - Show your research and exploration process
- **Use modern tools naturally** - No need to mention AI/productivity tools used
- **Zero tolerance for plagiarism** - Automated boilerplate will result in disqualification
- **Originality matters** - Show your unique approach and thinking
