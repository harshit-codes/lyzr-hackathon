"""
This package contains the query tools for the SuperChat agent.

The tools in this package are responsible for interacting with the different
data sources in the knowledge graph. Each tool is a subclass of `BaseTool`
and implements the `execute` method for performing a specific type of query.

The following tools are available:

- **RelationalTool**: For executing SQL queries against the Snowflake
  database. This tool is used for structured queries, such as counting,
  aggregating, and filtering data.

- **GraphTool**: For executing Cypher queries against the Neo4j database.
  This tool is used for graph traversal, pathfinding, and relationship
  queries.

- **VectorTool**: For performing semantic similarity search using vector
  embeddings. This tool is used for concept-based search and finding
  similar entities.
