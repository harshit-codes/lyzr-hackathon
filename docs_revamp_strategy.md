# Documentation Revamp Strategy (Simplified)

## 1. Guiding Principles

*   **Code is the ultimate source of truth:** All documentation must be validated against the actual codebase to ensure accuracy. We will not rely solely on existing markdown files, as they may be outdated.
*   **Single, unified documentation portal:** We will create a single, centralized documentation portal in the `/docs` directory, published to GitBook. This will be the single source of truth for all documentation.
*   **Developer-centric:** As an open-source project, our documentation will be geared towards developers who are also users and contributors.

## 2. Analysis

The current documentation is scattered across multiple directories (`/`, `/docs`, `/notes`, `/code`), leading to several problems:

*   **Redundancy:** The same information is repeated in multiple places.
*   **Outdated Content:** Many files, especially in the `/notes` and `/code` directories, are outdated and do not reflect the current state of the codebase.
*   **Lack of a Single Source of Truth:** There is no clear distinction between user-facing documentation, developer documentation, and internal notes.
*   **Poor Discoverability:** It's difficult to find the information you're looking for.

## 3. Proposed Strategy (Simplified)

The goal is to create a single, centralized documentation portal for the project that is accurate, up-to-date, and easy to use.

The strategy is as follows:

1.  **Single Source of Truth:** The `/docs` directory will be the single source of truth for all documentation, and it will be published to GitBook.
2.  **Code-Driven Documentation:** All documentation will be created or updated by first analyzing the relevant source code to ensure its accuracy.
3.  **Integrate All Documentation into GitBook:** All relevant and *accurate* information from the `/notes`, `/code`, and root-level `README.md` files will be migrated to the `/docs` directory and integrated into the GitBook structure.
4.  **Archive Internal Notes:** The `/notes` directory will be used for internal planning and brainstorming. Outdated and irrelevant notes will be moved to a new `/notes/archive` directory.
5.  **Minimal `README.md` Files:** The `README.md` files in the root and subdirectories will be kept to a minimum, primarily serving as pointers to the GitBook documentation.

## 4. Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Update the Strategy Document

*   [x] Update this document to reflect the simplified, code-driven strategy.

### Phase 2: Archive Outdated and Redundant Files

1.  Create a `notes/archive/` directory.
2.  Move all files from the `notes` directory (except for this file and `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`) to the `notes/archive/` directory.
3.  Move all `README.md` files from the `code` subdirectories to the `notes/archive/` directory.
4.  Move all root-level `.md` files (except for `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and this file) to the `notes/archive/` directory.

### Phase 3: Consolidate and Create Code-Driven Documentation into `/docs`

1.  **Analyze the source code:** Systematically review the Python files in the `code/` directory to understand the current implementation of each component (SuperScan, SuperKB, SuperChat).
2.  **Review the archived files:** Go through the files in `notes/archive/` to identify any high-level architectural concepts or design decisions that are still relevant.
3.  **Update the GitBook structure:** Update `docs/SUMMARY.md` to create a new, logical structure for the consolidated documentation, based on the actual codebase. The new structure should include sections for:
    *   Getting Started (installation, configuration)
    *   Architecture
    *   Core Components (SuperScan, SuperKB, SuperChat) - with details derived from the code.
    *   Contributing (code style, testing, etc.)
    *   API Reference (generated from docstrings if possible)
4.  **Create and migrate content:** Create new `.md` files in the `/docs` directory and write new documentation that accurately reflects the current state of the code. Migrate any relevant high-level concepts from the archived files.
5.  **Update the root `README.md`:** Update the root `README.md` to be a simple, welcoming entry point that directs users to the GitBook documentation.

### Phase 4: Modernize Codebase Documentation

This phase will be tackled after the documentation is centralized.

1.  **Improve docstrings:** Review and improve the docstrings for all public modules, classes, and functions, ensuring they are clear, concise, and follow a consistent format.
2.  **Add comments where necessary:** Add comments to explain complex logic.

This simplified, code-driven strategy will create a single, comprehensive documentation portal that is accurate, up-to-date, and easy to use for all members of the community.
